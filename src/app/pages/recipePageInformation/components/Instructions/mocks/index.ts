    "Preheat the waffle iron: Plug it in and wait for it to heat up, or turn it to a certain temperature, depending on the model you’re using. A small light will often come on when the waffle iron is ready. To test the temperature, let a drop or two of water fall on the plates of the waffle iron. The drops should sizzle and dance for 2-3 seconds before vanishing. If they sit there for much longer, the waffle iron isn’t warm enough yet. If they vanish in less than a couple of seconds, the waffle iron may be too hot.",
    "Mix the dry ingredients: Place the flour, salt, sugar, and baking powder into a medium-large bowl. For extremely fluffy waffles, sift the ingredients instead of simply mixing them.",
    "Separate the eggs: Use an egg separating tool to separate the yolks from the whites and place them in separate bowls. You can also crack the eggs in half and tip the yolk from shell half to shell half, letting the white drop to a bowl below. It’s essential to avoid getting any yolk in with the egg whites, as they won’t foam properly if there’s even a little yolk in them.",
    "Beat the egg whites: Use a whisk or a mixer to beat the egg whites until they foam and form soft peaks. They should be stiff but not dry.",
    "Beat the remaining wet ingredients: Beat the butter or oil and egg yolks in a separate bowl. Add the milk and vanilla, and continue beating until the ingredients are thoroughly combined.",
    "Combine the wet and dry ingredients: Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour the egg yolk mixture into the well. Stir everything together until everything is moist.",
    "Pour the batter: Pour the batter onto the hot, prepared waffle iron. The amount will depend on your waffle iron’s size and instructions. Close the lid.",
    "Cook until golden brown: Cook the waffles until they’re golden brown and crispy on the outside. Repeat with the remaining batter.",

const pancakesInstructions = {
  instructions: [
    "Sift the dry ingredients: In a large bowl, combine the plain flour and a pinch of salt.",
    "Add the wet ingredients: Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the milk and lightly whisked eggs. Give the liquid mixture a quick whisk before incorporating the flour.",
    "Whisk until smooth: Continue to whisk until you have a smooth batter.",
    "Add melted butter: Now add the melted butter and whisk thoroughly.",
    "Let the batter rest: Ideally, let the batter rest for 15–30 minutes. This helps the gluten relax, resulting in tender and thinner pancakes.",
    "Prepare the pan: Heat a crêpe pan or large frying pan over medium heat for 1 minute. Dip a piece of kitchen paper in oil and carefully wipe the inside of the pan.",
    "Cook the pancakes: ",
    "Pour just under a ladleful of batter into the pan.",
    "Immediately start swirling the pan to get a nice even layer.",
    "Cook the pancake for 30–40 seconds until the underside is golden brown.",
    "Use a palette knife to lift the pancake and check the color.",
    "Flip the pancake and cook the other side for approximately 30–40 seconds.",
    "Transfer to a serving plate.",
    "Serve and enjoy: Top your pancakes with lemon and sugar, chocolate spread, or any toppings your heart desires.",
