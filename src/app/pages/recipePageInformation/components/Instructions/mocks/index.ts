    "Preheat the waffle iron: Plug it in and wait for it to heat up, or turn it to a certain temperature, depending on the model you‚Äôre using. A small light will often come on when the waffle iron is ready. To test the temperature, let a drop or two of water fall on the plates of the waffle iron. The drops should sizzle and dance for 2-3 seconds before vanishing. If they sit there for much longer, the waffle iron isn‚Äôt warm enough yet. If they vanish in less than a couple of seconds, the waffle iron may be too hot.",
    "Mix the dry ingredients: Place the flour, salt, sugar, and baking powder into a medium-large bowl. For extremely fluffy waffles, sift the ingredients instead of simply mixing them.",
    "Separate the eggs: Use an egg separating tool to separate the yolks from the whites and place them in separate bowls. You can also crack the eggs in half and tip the yolk from shell half to shell half, letting the white drop to a bowl below. It‚Äôs essential to avoid getting any yolk in with the egg whites, as they won‚Äôt foam properly if there‚Äôs even a little yolk in them.",
    "Beat the egg whites: Use a whisk or a mixer to beat the egg whites until they foam and form soft peaks. They should be stiff but not dry.",
    "Beat the remaining wet ingredients: Beat the butter or oil and egg yolks in a separate bowl. Add the milk and vanilla, and continue beating until the ingredients are thoroughly combined.",
    "Combine the wet and dry ingredients: Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour the egg yolk mixture into the well. Stir everything together until everything is moist.",
    "Pour the batter: Pour the batter onto the hot, prepared waffle iron. The amount will depend on your waffle iron‚Äôs size and instructions. Close the lid.",
    "Cook until golden brown: Cook the waffles until they‚Äôre golden brown and crispy on the outside. Repeat with the remaining batter.",

    "Add melted butter: Now add the melted butter and whisk thoroughly.",
    "Let the batter rest: Ideally, let the batter rest for 15‚Äì30 minutes. This helps the gluten relax, resulting in tender and thinner pancakes.",
